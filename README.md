# Ray-Tracer
A simple Ray Tracer, using path tracing and written in Rust.

## About
This project is based on [the book series by Peter Shirley, *Ray Tracing in One Weekend*](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). It is nevertheless using C++ as a main language, so I adapted the original code snippets to Rust.
